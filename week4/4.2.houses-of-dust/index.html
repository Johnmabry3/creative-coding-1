        This is my, John Mabry III's, version of The House of Dust poem, based on the work by Alison Knowles. https://zkm.de/en/artwork/house-of-dust

        I had climate change in mind when creating this. I decided to create scenes and environments that combine inhabitants, light sources, and other places that may not be enjoyable due to absurd circumstances in that specific poem.

        Alison Knowles uses the House of Dust to create scenarios to get her audience to think about where the inhabitants are, their purpose of being there, and what materials their home is made of. I too had the mindset of ensuring my audience thinks about where the inhabitants are, their purpose of being there, how problematic it would be, and why they would even be using various light sources.
