        Use this page to complete the "Bounce" exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1498218/assignments/11723278

        This is my version of the bounce exercise. I added multiple
        shapes that bounce around the canvas, and you also see their
        previous positions still drawn on the canvas until they hit a
        new position on a different wall.
