        This is my 2nd version of my popsicle emoji. I decided to make a popsicle because I have never seen a popsicle emoji before. Usually, the types of soft serve treat emoji you see is of an ice cream cone.
        For my emoji, I also added a popsicle stick with two brown diagonal streaks.

        For this emoji, I went to canva palette generator to find colors that I would enjoy most.
