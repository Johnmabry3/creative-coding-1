    <title>Pixel Sorting</title> 
    <!--
        Use this page to complete the optional "Pixel Sorting" exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1498218/assignments/11723277

        In this exercise, I took a self portrait painting that I did and altered it to sort its pixels based on the saturation. I set the lower_threshold to "0.1," upper_threshold to "1.5," and the angle to 65.

            width: 100%;
        }
        canvas {
