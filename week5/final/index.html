    <title>Final Project</title> 

    <!--
        I completed the final project for week 5 using canvas,
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1498218/assignments/11723295

        I wanted to create a generative landscape that had some possible animation. Looking at the examples given on canvas, I wanted to do something that was in the middle of the featured landscapes.

        I referenced my code from Barney Codes:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJnSwHnYLhs&t=1s

        One thing that I wanted to do was use an thumbnail image that I created in regards to my podcast episode about Ai, but my code continued to say that there was an error with the preload function, and that it could not fetch the jpg.

        Instead of using the image, I used a U.S. Woodland camouflage patter to be banded throughout the canvas.

        This resulted in creating a topographical-like sketch.
